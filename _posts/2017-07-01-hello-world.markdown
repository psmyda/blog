<p>These are the words that have been pushing me to start blogging for almost a year now. And this is my first step.</p>

<p>I wanted to start blogging for many reasons but the most important for me right now is to start collecting my knowledge. I want to store things that I know or should already know for future reference. So basically I want to create a place where I can store things I learn and experience in my daily job and life. This is what you should expect when searching trough my posts.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">What will you find here?</h2>

<p>This is a list of things I want to write about somewhere in the future</p>

<ul>
  <li>C# and .NET</li>
  <li>Angular</li>
  <li>JavaScript / TypeScript</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Work - productivity, focus, goals, working remotely</li>
  <li>Agile - how itâ€™s done in teams I work with</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see this is a very wide spectrum of things and to be completely honest I'm not an expert in any of these but that is also the point of this blog existance.</p>

<p>I hope you will join me in this journey!</p>
